# Car Model and License Plate Detection 

A real-time deep learning-based system for **vehicle model classification** and **license plate detection & recognition** using **YOLOv5, EasyOCR, and ResNet50**.

This project detects vehicles from images/video streams, identifies the **car model**, and reads the **license plate number** accurately.

## Project Overview

The system works in three main stages:

1. **Vehicle Detection**
   - Uses YOLOv5 to detect cars from images or video frames.

2. **License Plate Detection & Recognition**
   - Detects license plates using YOLOv5.
   - Reads plate text using EasyOCR.

3. **Vehicle Model Classification**
   - Cropped vehicle images are passed to a ResNet50-based CNN.
   - Predicts the exact car make and model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- YOLOv5
- ResNet50
- EasyOCR
- OpenCV
- PyTorch

# Yolov5
“YOLOv5 is used as the object detection backbone and should be cloned separately from the official Ultralytics repository.”
